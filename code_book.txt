      The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers 
      within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities 
      (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
      wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded 
      accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 
      3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have 
      been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has 
      been aggregated into a dataset providing the average of each variable 
      for each activity and each subject.
